# PythonGame
This game was created in Cloud9 using Python 2.7.10. I made this game for fun over the course of two weekends and decided to post it on my Github account. It utilizes the use of functions such as: fight, attack, drink-potion, run and a store which houses weapons and potions. I made this game after the completion of several Python courses online.

If you would like to see the game in action, I have a compressed file which can be sent via email. Send me an email if you would like to see it - aryan.cheema.152@my.aquinas.me
