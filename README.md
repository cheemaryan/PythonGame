# PythonGame
This game was created in Cloud9 using Python 2.7.10. I made this game for fun over the course of two weekends and decided to post it on my Github account. It utilizes the use of functions such as: fight, attack, drink-potion, run and a store which houses weapons and potions. I made this game immediately after the completion of several Python courses online.
